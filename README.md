# Floating Image Viewer

Floating image viewer made to integrate with Greenshot but can be used as a standalone program as well
* Supports resizing and drawing
* Right click to access menu
* More features to come!

Still a work in progress with very messy code.

Configure Greenshot's external command plugin to use `FloatingImageViewer.exe` with the screenshot filename as the argument
